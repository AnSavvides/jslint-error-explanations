                    <a href="http://jslint.com">JSLint</a> seems to be proud of the fact that it will "hurt your feelings". Well that's OK, but it would be nice if it made it a bit clearer why it was hurting them.

                    This site is still a work in progress. Not all JSLint error messages are documented here yet. The code is all available on GitHub if you would like to help out! Alternatively, you can request an article for a specific error message by <a href="http://www.jamesallardice.com/contact/">contacting me</a> or raising an issue on GitHub.
