	<h3>When do I get this error?</h3>
</p>
<p>
	JSLint will throw the "Expected an identifier and instead saw '{a}' (a reserved word)" error when it expects <strong>a reference to an identifier but finds a keyword that is reserved by the language</strong>. In the following example we attempt to declare a variable with the identifier <span class="code">default</span>, which is a reserved word:
</p>
<textarea>
var default = 10;</textarea>
<p>
	This error can also be thrown when JSLint encounters an object property identifier that is a reserved word. This is valid in the ECMAScript 5 specification, but was not valid previously. In this example we attempt to declare an object property with the identifier <span class="code">default</span>:
</p>
<textarea>
var x = {
	default: "a default value"
};</textarea>
<p>
	<h3>Why do I get this error?</h3>
</p>
<p>
	For the first example above, this error is raised to highlight a <strong>JavaScript syntax error</strong>. Your code will not run if you do not fix this error. Reserved words are special identifiers that are set aside by the ECMAScript specification for special use.
</p>
<p>
	The specification defines three sets of reserved words. The first set is "keywords", which are all used by the current version of the language. Here's the full list (<a href="http://es5.github.com/#x7.6.1.1" target="_blank">ES5 &sect;7.6.1.1</a>):
</p>
<table class="table table-striped code">
	<tr>
		<td>break</td>
		<td>case</td>
		<td>catch</td>
		<td>continue</td>
		<td>debugger</td>
		<td>default</td>
		<td>delete</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>do</td>
		<td>else</td>
		<td>finally</td>
		<td>for</td>
		<td>function</td>
		<td>if</td>
		<td>in</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>instanceof</td>
		<td>new</td>
		<td>return</td>
		<td>switch</td>
		<td>this</td>
		<td>throw</td>
		<td>try</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>typeof</td>
		<td>var</td>
		<td>void</td>
		<td>while</td>
		<td colspan="3">with</td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p>
	The second set is "future reserved words", which are not currently used by the language but are expected to be used in the future. They are reserved now so that future code is backwards compatible. Here's the full list (<a href="http://es5.github.com/#x7.6.1.2" target="_blank">ES5 &sect;7.6.1.2</a>):
</p>
<table class="table table-striped code">
	<tr>
		<td>class</td>
		<td>const</td>
		<td>enum</td>
		<td>export</td>
		<td>extends</td>
		<td>import</td>
		<td>super</td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p>
	The third set is made up of identifiers that are also considered future reserved words, when they occur within <em>strict mode code</em>. JSLint will treat them in the same way as all of the previously listed reserved words, regardless of whether the code is in strict mode or not. Here's the list:
</p>
<table class="table table-striped code">
	<tr>
		<td>implements</td>
		<td>interface</td>
		<td>let</td>
		<td>package</td>
		<td>private</td>
		<td>protected</td>
		<td>public</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>static</td>
		<td colspan="6">yield</td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p>
	For the second example above, this error is raised to highlight a <strong>potential JavaScript syntax error</strong>. Your code will not run in browsers that do not support this feature of ECMAScript 5 (notably Internet Explorer 8 and below). If you do not care about these older browsers, you can tell JSLint to ignore this syntax by using the <span class="code">es5</span> directive:
</p>
<textarea>
/*jslint es5: true */
var x = {
	default: "a default value"
};</textarea>
<p>
	However, if you <em>do</em> need your code to run in older browsers, you will need to change your syntax slightly and quote the identifier so it's treated as a string rather than a reserved word:
</p>
<textarea>
var x = {
	"default": "a default value"
};</textarea>
